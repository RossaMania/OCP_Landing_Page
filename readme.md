# Omni Consumer Products Landing Page

This is a landing page for Omni Consujmer Products. This is the fictional corporation from the 1987 movie "RoboCop".

This was a chance for me to practice Bootstrap grid, and features a lg grid and xl grid in addition to the usual CSS media queries.

The color palette was inspired by the original logo presented on the video screens throughout the movie--after all, OCP is everywhere!

Instead of Lorem Ipsum, actual quotes from the movie are used, and the original trailer is featured in a YouTube embed at the bottom of the site.
